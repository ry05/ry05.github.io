#### Leveraging Data for Social Good

In this talk, I provide a detailed explanation about how my team and I visited a rural settlement in Northern India and used data science to diagnose their issues with inconsistent water distribution and proposed a sustainable solution to improve their lives. The talk was organized by [Meetup Madness](https://meetupmadness.io/) and it was great fun to be a part of their family!
