subtitle: My presence in the Data Science Community
---

I enjoy working in teams and helping build communities revolving around the use of data. I have held important positions in student clubs and forums since undergraduate and have been instrumental in developing ideas with my teams to make data science more accessible to beginners.

I also have been fortunate enough to present some of my technical work in public spaces. Hope you find something interesting here!

## Talks Presented

#### Building Great Projects with Deep Learning

This talk was presented as a guest lecture for the Deep Learning and Neural Networks elective at Amrita School of Engineering, Bengaluru. In the talk, I explored ways in which undergraduate students could structure their deep learning projects to learn concepts well and also build a magnificent product in the process.

#### Winners Interview on the Chai Time Data Science Podcast

In this episode of the CTDS podcast, I was interviewed along with my fellow CTDS contest winner Ms. Vrinda Prabhu, by Sanyam Bhutani. We talk about a variety of topics like getting into kaggle, our competition submissions and our experience with the podcast.

#### Leveraging Data for Social Good

In this talk, I provide a detailed explanation about how my team and I visited a rural settlement in Northern India and used data science to diagnose their issues with inconsistent water distribution and proposed a sustainable solution to improve their lives. The talk was organized by [Meetup Madness](https://meetupmadness.io/) and it was great fun to be a part of their family!

#### Introducing DataSwissKnife at DSC-OMG

In this talk, my team and I presented our project, DataSwissKnife(A tool to help with data science operations) on the online event DSC-OMG organized by the [Developer Student Club Initiative](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc). We represented DSC-ASEB and were amongst the 10 projects selected from all the projects done by DSCs across India! In the talk, we provide an overview of our tool, the need for it, the installation instructions and finally a demo to showcase its working.
