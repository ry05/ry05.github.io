### Identification of Criminal Activity Hotspots using Machine Learning to aid in Effective Utilization of Police Patrolling in Cities with High Crime Rates

**Abstract:** Criminal activity has always been a major deterrent in human progress and the constant presence of criminal activities stemming out of multifarious causes has been a hindrance for human sustainable living. The problem further aggravates when there is a dearth of police force to prevent crime. In countries like India where the police to population ratio is much less than the United Nations' Standard, the need of the hour is to efficiently utilize the existing force to prevent crimes. In this paper, we propose a solution that would facilitate effective distribution of police forces in a city among multiple districts based on the extent to which each district is prone to crime at a given hour, in a given day, for a given month. We have used the Chicago Crime Dataset in this work. The problem has been modelled as an imbalanced classification problem and supervised machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Trees have been employed and their performances have been evaluated. In particular, the Gradient Boosting Tree has achieved the best performance in our case.

### The Impact of Water Distribution Inconsistency in the Rural Settlements of Punjab and to Extrapolate a Nature Based Sustainable Technology to Enhance Livelihood  

**Abstract:** Water, is undoubtedly one of the most indispensable needs for the human population to survive. In India, almost 70% of the population reside in rural settlements and a large share of this population is often caught up in the gaping open traps of ignorance and lack-of-knowledge. According to the World Water Development Report 2018 by the UN, India is facing a stark water crisis with the report citing that over 40% of the renewable water sources in Central India would be withdrawn by 2050. Availability of water plays the role of a key indicator in the measure of a village’s prosperity and moreover it is an index of India’s development. As a part of the Live-in-Labs® the purpose of our study was to identify the most prevalent challenge that played the antagonizing role of holding back the development index in a small, destitute village tucked away in the northern part of Punjab, India by the name of Dodeneer. The paper aims at shedding light on the status of the key development indicators in the village, provide quantitative and qualitative measurables like the available resources in the village using a pragmatic approach to scrutinize the same and to propose a judicious solution to the pervasive challenge through an anthropocentric outlook. This paper would address the predominant water management issues of Dodeneer and also provide affable solutions to tackle the same and provide insights as to how Nature Based Solutions (NBS) would help address many of India’s water challenges while simultaneously delivering additional benefits vital to all aspects of sustainable development.
