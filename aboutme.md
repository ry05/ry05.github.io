### Who am I?

I go by the name of Ramshankar Yadhunath and I am a recent graduate of *Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering* from [Amrita School of Engineering, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India](https://www.amrita.edu/campus/bengaluru).

Like most 21 years, I too am in the process of carving out a niche for myself in the world and the one discipline where I really want to make an impact is data-driven decision making. As unrealistic as it may sound, the truth is that the *hype around Data Science* is not what engendered this idea of becoming a data scientist in me. Then what did?

### What is Data Science to me?

The reason why I want to be a data scientist is because *I want to generate value for society in **any way** that's possible*. And, Data Science precisely would help me do that. I also created a definition of Data Science(Academia, please don't frown upon me) to keep me motivated throughout this journey, so that *I would never forget the purpose with which I have embarked on this journey.* 

> Data Science to me, is the most far-reaching and mercurial of all disciplines ever created, cutting across multiple disciplines and providing people with a chance to make a difference in their respective fields by understanding uninspiring text and numbers(what we call data).
