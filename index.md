title: Hi! I am Ramshankar.

Welcome to my online space. I study Applied Social Data Science at the London School of Economics and Political Science. I am deeply passionate about data-driven decision making and the use of data for good.

In the past, I have led a team conducting an [on-site ethnographic study of water management issues in a North-Indian village](https://towardsdatascience.com/leveraging-data-for-social-good-a-practical-example-adac053bdeaa). I have also volunteered at People for Animals Wildlife Hospital, an urban wildlife shelter in Bengaluru, India where [I introduced the concept of animal shelter analytics](https://towardsdatascience.com/saving-animal-lives-with-data-d815c6e854eb). 

I enjoy working with data and including the outputs of analysis into the decision-making process of organizations. Apart from talking with data, I also love talking to people as I believe the success of any project depends on how many different ideas were considered while building it.
