**Hello! My name is Ramshankar Yadhunath**. I am currently pursuing my MSc in Applied Social Data Science degree with the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/). I completed my Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Amrita School of Engineering, Bengaluru (ASE-B), India](https://www.amrita.edu/campus/bengaluru) in July 2020. During my undergraduate study, I have been on a merit scholarship at the University. My final year project report  "Automating Data Science for Domain Experts" included a detailed study and implementation of different aspects that could be automated in the data science ecosystem, with a special focus on semi-automated data cleaning. 

My interests are sharply inclined towards the use of data to help organizations make better decisions. I have been the team lead on the [Live in Labs Program](https://www.amrita.edu/international/live-in-labs) at ASE-B and worked on providing a rural settlement In Northern India better opportunities to upscale their living standards with a focus on the village's water woes. The project involved conducting participatory rural appraisal, interviews, qualitative analysis and human-centered design to formulate a solution. This project was funded by the Live in Labs parent team at the University.

I also volunteer at the [People for Animals Wildlife Hospital, Bengaluru, India](https://peopleforanimalsbangalore.org/) and help the organization make better sense of its animal shelter data in order to save more animal lives. As of present, I have worked on data cleaning and data-driven storytelling at the shelter. 

A favorite place for me to be during my free time is the Kaggle platform. I am a [Kaggle Notebooks Expert](https://www.kaggle.com/thedatabeast) and have won the Chai Time Data Science podcast contest on Kaggle. Blogging is another activity I enjoy and here, I focus on trying to justify unpopular opinions and unmasking overlooked ideas in socially-relevant themes with the use of data.
