It's been 3 years since I joined Kaggle, but I have only been active on it the last few months. Yet, this short span of time has helped me achieve a great deal of knowledge from fellow Kagglers. 

From the eyes of a beginner who was too scared to step into Kaggle at first, I must say that *making the plunge was indeed very satisfying!* I became a Kaggle Notebooks Expert last night. In this post, I shall link to the 5 notebooks that helped me achieve this milestone. Hope you enjoy reading them!
