Let's face it. We all hate missing values. They are a pain to deal with, not just because they are missing but also because it takes quite a bit of effort to even understand why they are missing in the first place.

## Topics

1. Different imputation strategies basics with diagram and examples
2. Choose a dataset - Maybe titanic? or WiDS?
3. Scikit-learn's SimpleImputer class
4. IterativeImputer class
5. Time the imputation
6. Write some code to automate the imputation procedure
