**The Project Overview :**
This project is more of a story than a project. It's a story of how five 2nd year undergraduates studying various disciplines came together, put the differences in their thoughts aside, followed a practical methodology and helped over 300 tenants at a rural North Indian village that was so underprivileged that it did not even have a spot for it on the state's geographical map. 

**The Link to the Project :**
I have already covered this project in detail via an article in Medium and the code is available on my Github account. So, I shall leave that out here in case it interests my readers.
