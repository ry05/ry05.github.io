### How have I organized this page ?
This page contains details about projects that I have worked on. In order to help readers get the crux of my work with a single look, I have organized each project using a self-designed template :
- The Project Overview
- The Links to the Project
- Reason for the Project's proximity to my Heart
- Additional Materials (If applicable)

**The Project Overview :**
This project is more of a story than a project. It's a story of how five 2nd year undergraduates studying various disciplines came together, put the differences in their thoughts aside, followed a practical methodology and helped over 300 tenants at a rural North Indian village that was so underprivileged that it did not even have a spot for it on the state's geographical map. 

**The Links to the Project :**
I have already covered this project in detail via an article in Medium and the code is available on my Github account. So, I shall leave that out here in case it interests my readers.

**Reason for the Project's proximity to my Heart**
This was the first project that I worked on from end-to-end. Most smaller projects I worked on were way easier because in those, I had the data provided and I was not accountable to anybody for the kind of work I was doing. But, in this project it was all different. I only had a goal in my mind. I had to collect data from scratch and make sure that we had good results, else we would not be able to be of any use to the vilalge. The stakes were much higher in this project because it actually meant something to the villagers who had pinned their hopes on us from day 1 and that's the main reason why it is so close to my heart.

**The Project Overview :**
Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is one of the most crucial steps in a Data Science project. EDA in basic terms is a way of "Understanding the data with the help of visualizations and descriptive statistics". A lot of courses I signed up for in the past emphasised on the need to use EDA to understand datasets and use this information to either model a ML/DL problem or tell a convincing story about the dataset to a stakeholder.
Therefore, through this project I made an attempt at improving my EDA skills using the Chocolate Bar Ratings Dataset.

**The Links to the Project :**
The project's detailed code and related documentation can be found on my Github account.

**Reason for the Project's proximity to my Heart**
This was my first fully documented EDA project. It might not be the greatest work I have performed as far as EDA is concerned, but I also tried my hand at telling a story of the data that I had. Also, though I might not be a very neat designer(as of now), the infographic depicted above was my first attempt at making one to quantify my data analysis.
