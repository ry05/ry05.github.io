**The Project Overview :**
This project is my official submission to the [CTDS.show contest](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/chai-time-data-science/discussion/156137) held on Kaggle. The task was to unearth insights and tell an interesting/actionable story with the dataset of the [Chai Time Data Science podcasts](https://chaitimedatascience.com/). I won the contest and more details on my experience on this contest has been described in [this blog post](https://ry05.github.io/2020-07-25-making-perfect-chai/).

## CouReco - Simple Course Recommendation System for Online Courses

![](https://github.com/ry05/couReco/blob/master/img/coureco-init.JPG?raw=true)

**The Project Overview :**
CouReco is a minimalistic system built on the idea to help learners navigate through the courses on Coursera, aided by a data-driven strategy. Currently, CouReco only performs the task of identifying the most similar and most dissimilar courses to a selected course that is chosen by the learner from a pool of courses relevant to the skills the learner is interested in.

**The Links to the Project :**
The project's detailed code and related documentation can be found here

- [Github Repository](https://github.com/ry05/couReco)

**Reason for the Project's proximity to my Heart**  
- Used web scraping to create the dataset
- Deployed locally with Streamlit

**The Project Overview :**
This project is more of a story than a project. It's a story of how five 2nd year undergraduates studying various disciplines came together, put the differences in their thoughts aside, followed a practical methodology and helped over 300 tenants at a rural North Indian village that was so underprivileged that it did not even have a spot for it on the state's geographical map. 

**The Links to the Project :**
I have already covered this project in detail via an article in Medium and the code is available on my Github account. So, I shall leave those links out here in case you wish to know more.

- [Medium Article](http://bit.ly/village-data-analysis)
- [Github Repository](https://github.com/ry05/Live-in-Labs-Analysis)

**Reason for the Project's proximity to my Heart**
- Socially-relevant project
- Focus on end-to-end consideration
- Involvement of data collection practices
- Ethical obligation(The villagers had pinned their hopes on us to provide them with a solution to their water problems)

**The Project Overview :**
The project finds relevance in analysing the prevelance of areas of high crime rates(called hotspots) in cities. Through our work, we have gone a little deeper than conventional studies of criminal activity hotspots and have established a relation that ***If crime can vary across months, across days in the week and even across hours of the very same day; it is definitely a fact that the rate of crime will not remain constant across districts within a city at any point of time. Some may face greater vulnerabilities to criminal activity than others.*** Based on this idea, we put together a predictive modelling study that helped create a model that would be able to predict the relative susceptibilities of districts in a city based on past crime records in these regions at given time points(a time point is made up of hour, day and month).  

Our final work also took shape as a conference paper at CSITSS 2019 held at RVCE, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.

**The Project Overview :**
Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is one of the most crucial steps in a Data Science project. EDA in basic terms is a way of "Understanding the data with the help of visualizations and descriptive statistics". A lot of courses I signed up for in the past emphasised on the need to use EDA to understand datasets and use this information to either model a ML/DL problem or tell a convincing story about the dataset to a stakeholder.
Therefore, through this project I made an attempt at improving my EDA skills using the Chocolate Bar Ratings Dataset.
